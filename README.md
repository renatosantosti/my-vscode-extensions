## Extensões
Segue abaixo a lista de extensões e suas respectivas funcionalidades

###js-beautify for VS Cod
Beautify javascript, JSON, CSS, Sass, and HTML in Visual Studio Code.

VS Code uses js-beautify internally, but it lacks the ability to modify the style you wish to use. This extension enables running js-beautify in VS Code, AND honouring any .jsbeautifyrc file in the open file's path tree to load your code styling. Run with F1 Beautify (to beautify a selection) or F1 Beautify file.

###C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp)
C# extension for Visual Studio Code! This extension provides the following features inside VS Code:

Lightweight development tools for .NET Core.
Great C# editing support, including Syntax Highlighting, IntelliSense, Go to Definition, Find All References, etc.
Debugging support for .NET Core (CoreCLR). NOTE: Mono debugging is not supported. Desktop CLR debugging has limited support.
Support for project.json and csproj projects on Windows, macOS and Linux.

###ESLint  by  dbaeumer.vscode-eslint
Integrates ESLint JavaScript into VS Code.

###Prettier-Standard - JavaScript formatter
VS Code package to format your Javascript using Prettier and Standard.

###REST Client by humao.rest-client
